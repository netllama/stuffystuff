Random bits of code that I've hacked on:

* map.py: python script which can take a jigl ( http://xome.net/projects/jigl ) image html file, and add geo-coded data to it, including a Google Maps link
* get-tweets.py: python script which converts a twitter user's home timeline into an RSS feed.  Long ago, twitter provided this natively by default, but not any more.
* sonos_player.py: python tool for controlling Sonos speakers on a local network.  Capable of playing (local) MP3s, adjusting volume, pause/stop play.
